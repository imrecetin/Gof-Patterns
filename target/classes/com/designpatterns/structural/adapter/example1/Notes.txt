Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

You can create an Adapter. It is a special object that converts calls sent by one object to the format that another object can understand. 
Adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion happening behind the scenes.

Sometimes it is even possible to create two-way adapters that convert calls in both directions.

Real-World Analogy

Power plugs and sockets in different countries
When you fly from the US to Europe for the first time, you may get a surprise when you try to charge your laptop. 
The power plug & sockets standards vary between countries. That is why your US plug will not fit the German socket.
The problem can be solved by a power plug adapter that has the American-style socket and the European-style plug.
