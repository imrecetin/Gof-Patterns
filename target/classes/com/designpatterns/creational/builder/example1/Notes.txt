The Builder pattern suggests to extract the object construction code out of 
its own class and move it to separate objects called builders.

To create an object, you will need to call several building steps in a builder class.
The important part here is that you do not need to call all the steps. 
You can use only the steps necessary for producing a particular configuration of an object.
