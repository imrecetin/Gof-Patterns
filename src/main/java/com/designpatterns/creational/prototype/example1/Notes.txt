Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you produce new objects by 
copying existing ones without compromising their internals.

The Prototype pattern delegates cloning process to objects themselves.
Objects that can be cloned are called prototypes.

All prototype classes should have a common interface that makes it 
possible to copy objects even if their concrete classes are unknown.
