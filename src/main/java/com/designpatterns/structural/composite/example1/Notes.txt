Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree 
structures and allow clients to work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

The composite pattern makes sense only when your business model can be represented as a tree

The Composite pattern suggests treating all different Products and Boxes through a common interface that has a method getPrice().

Applicability
When you have to implement a tree-like structure that has simple elements and containers.
